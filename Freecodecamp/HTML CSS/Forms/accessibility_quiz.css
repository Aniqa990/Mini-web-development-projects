/*A useful property of an SVG (scalable vector graphics) is that it contains a path attribute which allows the image to be scaled without affecting the resolution of the resultant image.

Currently, the img is assuming its default size, which is too large. CSS has a max function which returns the largest of a set of comma-separated values. For example:

img {
  width: max(250px, 25vw);
}
In this example, img elements will have a minimum width of 250px. And as the viewport grows, the image will grow accordingly to be 25 percent of the viewport width.*/

/*As described in the freeCodeCamp Style Guide, the logo should retain an aspect ratio of 35 / 4, and have padding around the text.

First, change the background-color to #0a0a23 so you can see the logo. Then, use the aspect-ratio property to set the desired aspect ratio to 35 / 4.*/

/*To enable navigation on the page, add an unordered list with the following three list items:

INFO
HTML
CSS*/

/*Use the > selector to target the unordered list elements within the nav elements, and use Flexbox to evenly space the children.*/

/*The .sr-only text is still visible. There is a common pattern to visually hide text for only screen readers to read*/

/*To prevent unnecessary repetition, target the before pseudo-element of the p element, and give it a content property of "Question #".*/
