<!--Another important meta element for accessibility and SEO is the description definition. The value of the content attribute is used by search engines to provide a description of your page.

Add a meta element with the name attribute set to description, and give it a useful content attribute.-->

<!--To increase the page accessibility, the role attribute can be used to indicate the purpose behind an element on the page to assistive technologies. The role attribute is a part of the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), and accepts preset values.-->

<!--Every region role requires a label, which helps screen reader users understand the purpose of the region. One method for adding a label is to add a heading element inside the region and then reference it with the aria-labelledby attribute.-->

<!--Arguably, D.O.B. is not descriptive enough. This is especially true for visually impaired users. One way to get around such an issue, without having to add visible text to the label, is to add text only a screen reader can read.

Append a span element with a class of sr-only to the current text content of the third label element.-->
