                <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
                <p>Marie Curie, born Maria Skłodowska on November 7, 1867, in Warsaw, Poland, was a remarkable physicist and chemist. From a young age, Marie demonstrated an exceptional aptitude for science and a relentless curiosity. Despite the limited opportunities for women in science at the time, she pursued her passion with unwavering determination.</p>

                <h2>Discovery of Radioactivity</h2>
                <p>Marie and Pierre Curie's groundbreaking research on radioactivity revolutionized the field of science. In 1898, they discovered two new elements: polonium and radium. Their work was so pioneering that Marie became the first woman to win a Nobel Prize in 1903, sharing the Physics prize with Pierre and Henri Becquerel.</p>

                <h2>Further Achievements</h2>
                <p>After Pierre's tragic death in 1906, Marie continued their work with remarkable resilience. In 1911, she won her second Nobel Prize, this time in Chemistry, for her discovery of radium and polonium and her investigation into the properties of these elements. Marie Curie remains the only person to have won Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields.</p>

                <h2>Contributions to Medicine and World War I</h2>
                <p>Marie Curie's research had significant medical applications, particularly in the treatment of cancer through radiation therapy. During World War I, she developed mobile radiography units, known as "Little Curies," which provided X-ray services to field hospitals, greatly aiding the treatment of wounded soldiers.</p>

                <h2>Personal Life and Values</h2>
                <p>Marie Curie was known for her modesty, dedication, and passion for science. Despite her fame, she remained humble and focused on her research, often working in challenging conditions. Her perseverance and integrity are as inspiring as her scientific accomplishments.</p>

                <h2>Honors and Memorials</h2>
                <p>Marie Curie's contributions have been recognized worldwide. She has been honored with numerous awards, honorary degrees, and memorials. In 1995, her ashes were enshrined in the Panthéon in Paris, making her the first woman to receive this honor for her own achievements.</p>
